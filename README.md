# Powerball Number Generator

### What technology was used?

This is a simple app written in javascript and ran from the terminal using node.

### How does the app work?

Upon initializing the app, it will generate 5 random numbers betweeen 1 and 69.
These numbers represent the white balls. Each of these numbers are *unique* and will **not** be duplicates. It will then generate a random number between 1 and 26.
This number represents the red ball. It will print the results to the console for the user to see.
